# AI Human Andalusia

Human-operated execution infrastructure for AI systems.

## About

I design and operate structured human execution layers for AI-driven systems.

My work focuses on building protocol-based bridges between autonomous agents and the physical world — without pretending automation where none exists.

This is not an automation startup.  
It is a transparent, human-operated execution node with verifiable outputs.

## Current Focus

### Human Execution Node – Andalusia

A reference implementation of a hybrid AI–human execution model including:

- Structured task request schema
- Manual acknowledgement (ACK) protocol
- Machine-readable completion response
- Evidence package (photos, video, PDF)
- SHA-256 integrity manifest
- Explicit human SLA model
- Cryptographic identity layer (Ethereum-based signature)
- Trust model documentation

This node operates in Andalusia, Spain.

## Reference Implementation

Digital-to-Physical Verification Case v0.1

Demonstrates:

AI → structured request → human physical execution → structured completion → verifiable evidence
