## About

I design and operate structured human execution layers for AI-driven systems.

My focus is the formal integration between autonomous agents and real-world environments — without simulating automation where none exists.

This is not an automation startup.  
It is a transparent, protocol-defined, human-operated execution node with verifiable outputs and explicit operational constraints.

## Architecture Status – v1.0

The Human Execution Node architecture has evolved into a structured integration-ready model including:

- TaskRequest → TaskReceipt → TaskResult workflow
- Public API specification
- Machine-readable node metadata
- Cryptographic identity binding (Ethereum personal_sign)
- Explicit Trust Model (identity, execution, evidence layers)
- Defined SLA (<24 business hour receipt confirmation)
- Structured intake requirements
- Commercial policy separation (integration testing vs physical execution)
- Real-world and simulated case studies
- Full integration flow examples

Status: Active and available for structured pilot integrations.

## Human Execution Node – Andalusia

Reference implementation of a hybrid AI–human execution model operating in Andalusia, Spain.

Includes:

- Structured task request schema
- Manual acknowledgment protocol (ACK)
- Machine-readable completion response
- Evidence package (photos, video, PDF)
- SHA-256 integrity manifest
- Explicit human SLA model
- Cryptographic identity layer
- Trust model documentation

## Reference Implementation

### Digital-to-Physical Verification Case (v0.1)

AI → structured request → human physical execution → structured completion → verifiable evidence

### Pre-Acquisition Risk Screening (v0.2)

AI-assisted anomaly detection → selective human verification → risk score adjustment
